# JeditFX
JeditFX is a very lightweight texteditor written in JavaFX similar to Notepad on Windows or Textedit on OSX.
The purpose was to do a small demo app in javafx for opening large files

Actually the editor can handle files as big as the RAM is. Some source is already there to extend this function to limitless file size
The name JeditFX is derived from Jedit but is far from being Jedit with a nicer GUI. Maybe sometimes in the future it will be there but actually it is only a simple text editor

Commented out in the maven file is also the compiling with GraalVM. Basically functional but the packaging is missing and therefore I decided to go with JPackage option.

This is my first github project and I do not know how I can do the build of the project automatically. Maybe someone else can pick this up. Just create an issue and I can give you the right to write to the repo.
